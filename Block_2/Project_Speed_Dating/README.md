# Block 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis
# Project: Speed Dating


This project is the project submitted for the validation of block 3 of my Designer Developer certification in data science following my training at Jedha

## Project context and objective

The marketing team of Tinder observes a decrease in the number of matches among its users.
In order to better understand what makes people interesting into each other, they decided to conduct a speed dating experiment by collecting a lot of information from the participants.

The objective here is therefore to use the data thus collected in order to define which attributes and criteria can lead to a match.

## Dataset
