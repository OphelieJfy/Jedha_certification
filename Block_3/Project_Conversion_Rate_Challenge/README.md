# Block 3 - Machine Learning
# Project: Conversion rate challenge


This project is the project submitted for the validation of block 3 of my Designer Developer certification in data science following my training at Jedha

## Deliverables

A notebook with :
- exploratory data analysis and visualizations
- machine learning training 
- performance assesment and interpretations

The leaderboard with scores.

## Project context and objective

The data scientists who created the newsletter www.datascienceweekly.org would like to understand better the behaviour of the users visiting their website.   
They would like to know if it's possible to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter, by using just a few information about the user.  
They would like to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight features that are important to explain the behaviour of the users, and maybe discover a new lever for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate.

The project (as well as the notebook) is constructed as followed:
- Part 1 : EDA
- Part 2 : Training of baseline model and improve f1-score on train set
- Part 3 : Make predictions with test set and submit to the leaderboard
- Part 4 : Analyze the best model's parameters and try to make recommendations to improve the conversion rate in the future

## Dataset

The dataset and features description used for this project are available [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourism/ds-conversion-rate) and has been copied (as provided by Jedha) in the 'data' folder of this repository.
