# Block 3 - Machine Learning
# Project: Wallmart Sales


This project is the project submitted for the validation of block 3 of my Designer Developer certification in data science following my training at Jedha

## Deliverables

A notebook with :
- exploratory data analysis and visualizations
- preprocessings, baseline model and regularized models
- performance assesment and interpretations

A 10 minutes project presentation video : 

## Project context and objective

Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores from the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company was founded by Sam Walton in 1962.

Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

The project (as well as the notebook) is constructed as followed:
- Part 1 : EDA and data preprocessing
- Part 2 : Baseline model (linear regression)
- Part 3 : Fight overfitting

## Dataset

The dataset has been taken from a Kaggle competition available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/walmart-sales-forecast), but changes have been made by Jedha so the dataset used in this project has been copied in the 'data' folder of this repository.
