# Block 3 - Machine Learning
# Project: Uber Pickups


This project is the project submitted for the validation of block 3 of my Designer Developer certification in data science following my training at Jedha

## Deliverables

A notebook with exploratory data analysis, preprocessings and two unsupervised algorithms.

Two html pages (in figures folder) to visualize the results of the two unsupervised clustering algorithms.

A 10 minutes project [presentation video](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/C6szU5AJy4jqRWDzdr4ZVU?).

## Project context and objective

In order to **advise Uber drivers on where to be according to the time of day** in order to best respond to user requests, the objective of this project is to **define "hot-zones"** from the usage data recorded by Uber.
Two clustering algorithms will be used to answer this question (KMeans and DBSCAN).

The project (as well as the notebook) is constructed as followed:
- Part 1 : Exploratory data analysis and preprocessings
- Part 2 : KMeans clustering algorithm
- Part 3 : DBSCAN clustering algorithm

## Dataset

The complete dataset being too heavy to be loaded on Git, it can be downloaded directly [here](https://full-stack-bigdata-datasets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Machine+Learning+non+Supervis%C3%A9/Projects/uber-trip-data.zip).

However, the month of September used in this analysis is available in the data folder.
