## Project context and objective

One of the main pain point that AT\&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT\&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

The objective is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based sollely on the sms' content.

## Dataset

The dataset has been copied in the 'data' folder of this repository.
